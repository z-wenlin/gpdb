# Greenplum-specific tests
#
# The order of the tests is fairly random, but there are a couple of things
# to consider when placing a new test:
#
# * Keep long-running tests in the same group with other tests with a similar
#   runtime. That way, on a multi-processor system, the tests will finish
#   roughly at the same time, which maximizes parallelism.
# * Keep tests together with other tests for similar functionality.
# * There are some dependencies between tests, and some tests cannot run
#   in parallel with other tests.
# * The maximum size of a group is about 20, like in the Postgres
#   parallel_schedule. However, some queries can dispatch a lot of workers
#   to the segments, and therefore has to run in smaller groups to avoid
#   hitting max_connections limit on segments.
